  blocks:
  - title: B2B Online Directories
    content: Directory that connects industrial businesses with other businesses supplying
      them with business-related commercial products. Client revenue is based on visitors
      clicking out of the directory to the advertiser's website. Each category / listing
      may have different revenue (to the client) per click to the advertiser's website.
      Thus extensive and frequent optimizations of keywords and ad copies are required
      to maintain client profitability.
  - title: B2C Online Directories
    content: Directory that connects businesses to customers in the entertainment,
      home services, and other similar industries. Client revenue is based on viewing
      the merchant landing page. Client offers "Click Packages" to its advertisers
      - a given number of clicks for a given amount of money. Objective of the campaign
      is to generate quality clicks based on the "Click Package" and minimizing the
      amount spent.  Campaign performance, and the fees, is based on the ROAS (Return
      On Advertising Spend). Keyword and ad copy optimized on a per-category basis.
  - title: Real Estate Aggregator
    content: Directory that showcases homes for sale from home builders and realtors.
      Client revenue is based on landing page visits. Keywords and ad copies regularly
      optimized on a per-category (e.g., homes for sale, apartments for rent) basis
      - to increase the number of landing page visits for the given budget.
  - title: Automobile - Used Car / OEM
    content: Automobile dealers, both new and used, for parts and service. Client
      revenue is based on landing page visits. Keywords and ad copy are generated
      automatically based on the dealer inventory. Keywords and ad copies optimized
      on a per-category / inventory  basis.
  - title: Greeting Cards
    content: Electronic greeting cards with advertising. Client revenue is based on
      the downloading / sending of eCards. Objective of the campaign is to generate
      100+ downloads per day within a predefined cost per download. Adopted a portfolio
      campaign management strategy, where each campaign was optimized individually,
      but with the goal of meeting the overall objective. All the optimizations (bid
      changes, pausing / adding keywords, changing ad copy) performed manually and
      achieved desired results.
  - title: Educational Institutes
    content: Both online and offline. Client revenue is based on signups. Thus extensive
      optimization was performed on a customized basis for the specific needs of each
      particular advertiser - maximizing the number of signups within the given budget.
