  content: Boonze helps SMBs, large companies, and in-house marketing teams manage
    their digital marketing campaigns. Through our 15-year history in digital marketing,
    we’ve had the pleasure of working with some remarkable clients to produce some
    truly amazing work that we are proud to have been a part of.
  blocks:
  - title: B2B Online Directories
    content: Directories that connect industrial businesses with suppliers of the
      commercial products that they need. Client revenue is based on visitors clicking
      out of the directory to the advertisers’ websites. Each category / listing may
      have different revenue (to the client) per click to the advertiser's website.
      Thus extensive and frequent optimizations of keywords and ad copy are required
      to maintain client profitability.
  - title: B2C Online Directories
    content: Directories that connect businesses to customers in the entertainment,
      home services, and other industries. Client revenue is based on viewing the
      merchant landing page. Our clients offer "Click Packages'' to advertisers -
      a given number of clicks for a given amount of money. The Objective of the campaign
      is to generate quality clicks based on the click package and minimizing the
      spend.  Campaign performance, and fees, are based on the ROAS (Return On Advertising
      Spend) of the program. Keyword and ad copy can be customized to each advertiser
      or optimized on a per-category basis.
  - title: Real Estate Aggregator
    content: Directories that showcase homes for sale from home builders and realtors.
      Client revenue is based on landing page visits. Keywords and ad copies are regularly
      optimized on a per-category (e.g., homes for sale, apartments for rent) basis.
      This increases the number of landing page visits for the given budget.
  - title: Automobile - Used Car / OEM
    content: Automobile dealers, both new and used, for parts and service. Client
      revenue is based on landing page visits. Keywords and ad copy are generated
      automatically based on the dealer inventory. Keywords and ad copies optimized
      on a per-category / inventory  basis.
  - title: Greeting Cards
    content: Electronic greeting cards with advertising. Client revenue is based on
      the downloading / sending of eCards. Objective of the campaign is to generate
      100+ downloads per day within a predefined cost per download. Adopted a portfolio
      campaign management strategy, where each campaign was optimized individually,
      but with the goal of meeting the overall objective. All the optimizations (bid
      changes, pausing / adding keywords, changing ad copy) performed manually and
      achieved desired results.
  - title: Educational Institutes
    content: Both online and offline. Client revenue is based on signups. Thus extensive
      optimization was performed on a customized basis for the specific needs of each
      particular advertiser - maximizing the number of signups within the given budget.
