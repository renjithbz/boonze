=========================================================

Boonze website workflow
Hugo static site source (hosted on GitHub)
           ↓
      Forestry.io (CMS editor)
           ↓ (commits Markdown/HTML changes)
        GitHub Repo
           ↓ (triggered via GitHub webhook)
        Netlify (builds and hosts site)
           ↓
     https://www.boonze.com  (live website)

So:
Forestry → make content editing easy.
GitHub → source code & content.
Netlify → built and hosted the live website automatically.

About Forestry
Forestry announced it would sunset (retire) its platform — they stopped new sign-ups in June 2022 and fully shut down the service by April 2024. So as of now, Forestry.io no longer works
